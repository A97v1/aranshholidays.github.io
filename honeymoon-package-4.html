     In regard to our discussion, please find the trip details below. If you‚Äôd like any 
     modifications, feel free to let us know ‚Äî our team at ARANSH HOLIDAYS will gladly 
     customize the itinerary for you. Munnar, the lush hill station nestled in the heart 
     of Kerala, sets the perfect tone for a journey through this enchanting southern 
     paradise. Kerala, with its timeless beauty, seamlessly blends nature, culture, and

     the serene backwaters of Alleppey and golden shores of Kovalam, the state is a perfect 
     retreat for families, couples, and soul-seekers alike. Whether you‚Äôre cruising through 
     palm-lined canals on a traditional houseboat, experiencing vibrant Kathakali 
     performances, embracing the healing touch of Ayurveda, or simply unwinding in the 
     rhythm of village life, Kerala promises a refreshing and unforgettable escape into '
     God‚Äôs Own Country'. <br> While credit and debit cards are widely accepted, it's
